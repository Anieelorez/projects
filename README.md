Flask Application Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes
Overview
This repository contains the source code and deployment configurations for a Flask application. The project incorporates version control with Git, containerization using Docker, Kubernetes for orchestration, and a CI/CD pipeline implemented through GitHub Actions.

Project Structure
app/: Contains the Flask application code.
Dockerfile: Describes the steps to build a Docker image for the application.
kubernetes/: Includes Kubernetes deployment configurations.
.github/workflows/: Contains GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
Getting Started
To run the Flask application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t flask-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
Access the application at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Docker
The application is containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile includes all the necessary instructions to create a Docker image for the Flask application.

To build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/flask-app:latest .
docker push your-dockerhub-username/flask-app:latest

Kubernetes Deployment
The kubernetes/ directory contains YAML files for deploying the Flask application to Kubernetes. Apply the deployment and service configurations using:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
This assumes you have a running Kubernetes cluster.

Continuous Integration and Deployment
The repository is integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow defined in .github/workflows/main.yml automates the build and deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

Workflow Steps:
Build Docker Image: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
Deploy to Kubernetes: Applies the Kubernetes deployment configurations for the Flask application.
